                    Participation to RAEMA is based on an <b>annual subscription</b> by <b>contract</b> between <b>ASA and your laboratory</b>.
                    Following the subscription, a <b>number of laboratory</b> and a <b>password</b> are attributed to each participant.
                    The preservation of these <b>codes</b> is essential; they enable laboratories to <b>input their results</b>
                    and to <b>download their report</b>, ensuring <b>confidentiality</b>.
                                    <br /><br />
                    Made for <b>one year</b>, this <b>contract</b> is <b>extended by tacit agreement</b> (Article 3 of contract).
                    The amount of subscription is voted at the beginning of each year by the general assembly
                    at which each member is invited (Article 1 of contract).
                    Laboratories are then informed about the voted prices. Download the contract for powder RAEMA.

					<u>- Additional packages:</u>

                    Each laboratory can order <b>additional packages</b>. <b>Like the first one</b>, they offer laboratories <b>more powder</b>
                    to assess different methods or different laboratory technicians.
						<br />Two options are proposed:

						<br />
                    A <b>second laboratory’s number and a second password</b> are given to the laboratory, that allow to <b>input results</b> of the additional package.
                    The laboratory will receive an <b>individual report</b> in accordance to its additional package.
						<br />
						
							<u><b>	- Additional package without edition of a Cofrac report:</b> </u>
                      The laboratory can’t input the results of its additional package. He must interpret its data internally.
                      At the end of the scheme, in order to finalize its analysis,
                      the laboratory can contact ASA to obtain information about the link between
                      its methods of analysis and the groups that have been constituted.
