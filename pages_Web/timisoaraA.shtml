          <b>The Fifth International Proficiency Testing Conference</b> took place in Timisoara (Romania)
          from 16th September to 18th September 2015.
          <b>110 participants from 27 countries</b> were present:
          Proficiency Testing Providers, accreditation body, laboratories, …
          <br/><br/>
          <b>ASA</b> participated to this conference and <b>Leïla ALI MANDJEE</b> presented an oral communication
          “<b>Development of a gelified matrix, support for proficiency testing schemes in food microbiology</b>”. 
          <br/><br/>

          After an introduction of ASA and <b>its interlaboratory comparison RAEMA</b>, that has been well established since 1988;
          the presentation focused on the work on gelified matrix especially for two microorganisms,
          <i>Bacillus cereus</i> and Lactic Acid Bacteria. At first, the experimental design was described,
          then the results were shown. According to ISO 17043, the requirements of homogeneity and stability
          were reached and ASA has been able to create since 2010, two Proficiency Testing schemes per year,
          named supplementary RAEMA. Since July 2015, ASA has been accreditated by <b>Cofrac</b>, according to <b>ISO 17043</b>,
          to organize and supply <b>supplementary RAEMA</b> for the two parameters:
          enumeration of <b><i>Bacillus cereus</i></b> and <b>Lactic Acid Bacteria</b>.
          These two parameters have increased the scope of Cofrac accreditation of ASA.
          (accreditation n°1-1836 <a href="http://www.cofrac.fr/fr/organismes/fiche.php?entite_id=12085864" target="_blank">
          available here </a>)
          <br/><br/>
          Several oral communications and posters were presented on different field of proficiency testing schemes:
          water chemistry, clinical microbiology, pesticides, cement industry, data analysis, …

          </p>
          Two <b>training courses</b> were organized during the conference. <br/>
          The first one, coordinated by <b>Mrs Steluta DUTA</b>, was related to the <b>use of reference materials</b>
          and <b>certified reference materials</b>, according to <b>ISO Guide 35</b>.<br/><br/>
          The second one was moderated by <b>M. Piotr ROBOUCH</b> and <b>M. Daniel W. THOLEN</b> and focused
          on the new version of the standard “<b>ISO 13528: 2015 – Statistical methods for use in
          proficiency testing by interlaboratory comparisons</b>”. The main changes were listed,
          as well as the axis of development. The statistical methods must be linked to the objectives
          fixed by providers for their Proficiency Testing scheme. More information must be provided to participants
          such as <b>uncertainty</b>. Its significance increase and the zeta-score, which includes this parameter,
          can be considered as an educational tool. This must be highlighted by proficiency testing providers.
          A presentation of “<b>Bootstrap</b>” completed this training course. This statistical method is based on an estimation
          of an estimator by resampling the original sample. It makes the calcul of assigned values, standard deviation,
          uncertainty possible in every conditions (bimodal and asymetric distribution).
          Then, <b>working groups</b> promoted exchanges between participants and experts.<br/><br/>

          After the opening ceremony, <b>Mrs Virginia Graziela GUSLICOV</b>, president of the steering committee,
          closed this 5th International Proficiency Testing Conference. The members of steering committee,
          organization, experts and participants were all thanked.<br/><br/>
